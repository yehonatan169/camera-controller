# 🚨 Emergency Camera Access System

This project was developed as part of a **hackathon**, with the goal of enabling secure and fast access to surveillance cameras in emergency scenarios — combining facial verification, streamlined authorization, and real-time live stream access.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Our application allows authorized users to:

- Log in with a secure **name and password**
- Simulate **face recognition scanning**
- Submit camera access requests by region and settlement
- View **live camera streams**
- Simulate textual analysis of stream areas

### 🎯 Why It Matters

In emergency or high-risk situations, rapid camera access can:
- Help commanders and first responders make better decisions
- Reduce response time in dynamic or dangerous environments
- Provide real-time context through secure and visual access
- Might eventually save lifes
